# Stack Algorithms Practice

Welcome to my small **Stack Algorithms Practice** project!
In this project, I’ve explored the usage of stacks in solving various algorithmic challenges. Stacks are essential data structures that play a critical role in numerous real-world applications. Here's a breakdown of how **basic**, **intermediate**, and **advanced** algorithms and data structures are used in my small stack project.

##  Introduction: What is a Stack?

A **Stack** is a simple but powerful data structure that follows the **LIFO** principle:
> **Last In, First Out**  
The last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed — just like a stack of plates!

###  Why Learn Stack?

Stacks are everywhere in computer science! Learning stacks is important because:

- They help solve real-world problems like undo/redo operations, backtracking, expression evaluation, and more.
- They are the foundation for solving advanced algorithm and system design problems.
- Understanding stacks builds strong fundamental programming skills.

##  Where Are Stacks Used? (Real-World Examples)

Stacks are not just theory — they solve **real-world problems** every day! Here are some practical examples:

| **Real-World Scenario**                         | **How Stack Helps**                                                                                                                                              |
|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Undo/Redo in Text Editors** (like Word, VS Code)  | Every change you make is pushed onto a stack. When you undo, it pops the last change!                                                                           |
| **Browser History Navigation**                  | Your visited pages are stored in a stack. Clicking "Back" pops the last page, "Forward" pushes it back.                                                          |
| **Expression Evaluation**                       | Programming languages use stacks to evaluate math expressions like `2 + (3 * 5)`.                                                                                |
| **Syntax Checking in Compilers**                | Compilers use stacks to check for correct matching of brackets, braces `{}`, `()`, `[]`.                                                                         |
| **Recursive Function Calls**                    | Function calls are managed by a **call stack**. Every time you call a function, it’s added to the stack.                                                         |
| **Backtracking Algorithms**                     | Algorithms like solving mazes, puzzles (like Sudoku) use stacks to backtrack and find solutions.                                                                  |
| **Reversing Data**                              | Stacks are used to reverse strings, lists, numbers efficiently.                                                                                                 |
| **Parsing HTML/XML**                            | While reading HTML/XML files, stacks ensure that all tags are properly opened and closed.                                                                        |
| **Memory Management**                           | In low-level systems (like C/C++), stacks are used for managing memory during program execution.                                                                 |

>  **In short:**  
Whenever you need to **remember the history**, **undo actions**, **reverse things**, or **track matching pairs**,   you probably need a **Stack**!
